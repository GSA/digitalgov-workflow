## Tools and Resources
This information is crucial to modernizing services and much of it is government-specific, dealing with the various rules, regulations and policies.

Access to the right tools and resources will help them confidently take steps toward working smarter, iterating more frequently and  delivering better, more effective services to the public.

## Examples of problems being solved in government

Examples of other agencies’ success are some of the most powerful tools toward convincing colleagues to follow modern practices.

They want more information that is specific to government — examples of what agencies are doing; case studies; collections of validated federal-wide news that has an impact on digital in one spot.


## Collaboration

People are interested in participating in spaces where they can more seamlessly communicate and share ideas between teams, with ‘points of contacts’ designated on various topics.

## How do they want it?

They need concise pieces of information to share with others, whom they manage, or work with, and may not have as much knowledge on a particular topic. They need that information to be easily shareable, printable and easy to distribute.

This information can take the form of:

- well-organized and maintained lists of tools
- resources
- checklists
- and short videos

{% footnote %}
This guidance stems from qualitative user research we conducted with over nearly two dozen federal members of our audience — content managers, designers, developers, innovation leaders — who are involved with all aspects of agencies’ digital services.

As we found in listening to them, they are working against incredible odds, and yet continuously exhibit a desire to be resourceful, perseverant, resilient. We should all be proud to call them civil servants. :heart: {% endfootnote %}
