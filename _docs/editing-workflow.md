In this next version of digital.gov, we are doing more to elevate the people behind the great work that is happening in government. When you and your team do great work, we’d like to make sure others in government know the people behind it.

To do this, we’ve improved our profile pages to reflect the information people need to better connect and collaborate with each other. Now we need your help in keeping your profile current.

**Check to see if you have a profile on digital.gov »**

**How to update your profile:**
- Ensure that you have a [free GitHub account](https://github.com/) — read our [guide to setting up a GitHub account]({% link _docs/github-account.md %}) and how it'll be used
- [Go to our list of authors](https://demo.digital.gov/authors/) and find your name
- Click on your profile
