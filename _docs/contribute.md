## Useful Tools and Resources

This information is crucial to modernizing services and much of it is government-specific, dealing with the various rules, regulations and policies.

Access to the right tools and resources will help them confidently take steps toward working smarter, iterating more frequently and  delivering better, more effective services to the public.

Send us one of the following ways:
- A link to an existing resource page on your site—along with a short description explaining what this resource is for, and which topics best apply
- 1-2 sentences pitching a resource page you think we should have
- A draft of a resource you’re working on


## News, updates, blog posts, tweets

Did your team recently launch something that you’d like to share with others in government? We’d like to hear about it.

Send us one of the following:
- A link to something on social media you'd like us to share
- A link to a blog post talking about it
- A draft of a blog post you’re working on
- 1-2 sentences pitching an idea for a future blog post

_:stopwatch: Expect blog posts to publish 1-2 weeks after final copy is received._

{% endnote %}

## Case studies, examples of problems solved

Examples of other agencies’ success are some of the most powerful tools toward convincing colleagues to follow modern practices.

Product managers in government need more information that is specific to government — examples of what agencies are doing; case studies; collections of validated federal-wide news that has an impact on digital in one spot.

Send us one of the following:
- 1-2 sentence blurb describing what you want to write about
- Agency you work for and team you’re on
- Provide a photo of the team

We cannot accept pitches around promotional content.



{% footnote %}
This guidance stems from qualitative user research we conducted with over nearly two dozen federal members of our audience — content managers, designers, developers, innovation leaders — who are involved with all aspects of agencies’ digital services.

As we found in listening to them, they are working against incredible odds, and yet continuously exhibit a desire to be resourceful, perseverant, resilient. We should all be proud to call them civil servants. :heart: {% endfootnote %}
