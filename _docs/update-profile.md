In this next version of digital.gov, we are doing more to elevate the people behind the great work that is happening in government. When you and your team do great work, we’d like to make sure others in government know the people behind it.

To do this, we’ve improved our profile pages to reflect the information people need to better connect and collaborate with each other. Now we need your help in keeping your profile current.
