## Elevate digital literacy and understanding

We aim to unpack complexity and make it possible for a wide audience to confidently understand digital.

## Bring a human focus to digital

We cannot talk about technology without talking about the people who create it, and the people it affects.

## Don’t fear the problems

We believe talking about challenges and unsolved problems is as important as talking about proven solutions.

## Make collaboration easy

Open collaboration across government is critical to a secure, digital future. It’s Digital.gov’s job to enable collaboration and make it easier.

## Listen

Everything we do is informed by what our audience needs. We apply multiple methods for measuring, listening, and understanding to our products.

## Work in the open

We do all of our work in the open and strive to organize our work in ways that allow others to participate.
