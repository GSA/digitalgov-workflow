**Through our user research**, we have found that there are three things product managers in government need to be successful in their work.

People need concise pieces of information to share with others, whom they manage, or work with, and may not have as much knowledge on a particular topic.

They need that information to be easily shareable, printable and easy to distribute.

This information can take the form of:
- well-organized and maintained lists of tools,
- resources,
- checklists
- and short videos
